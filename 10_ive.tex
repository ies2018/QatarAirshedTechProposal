\chapter{INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE EMISSIONS (IVE) MODEL}

The International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) model version 2.0 (\url{http://www.issrc.org/ive/}) is a computer model developed by the USEPA to estimate emissions from motor vehicles outside the United States. Its prime purpose is for use in developing countries.  The model predicts local air pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, and toxic pollutants.\\

The model requires input files that describe the vehicle fleet and vehicle activity (i.e. driving behaviour) for the location of interest.  A third optional input file is used if the location of interest has site specific emission rate information.  Too use this model,  fleet and activity information must be collected.
