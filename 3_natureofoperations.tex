\chapter{NATURE OF INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS}
Qatar is a peninsula that extends approximately 160 km into the Arabian Gulf. The main city, Doha, is located on the eastern coast of the country. The two project locations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:qatar}. Both sites are located near the coast and are therefore subject to land-sea breeze (LSB) circulation .  QP has various types of industrial operations at the two locations of the study.\\
